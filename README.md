# Remote-Desktop-Browser
So. What is this remote desktop in browser thing? Well, it's one of the first I've seen, it's a Remote desktop that you can run in browser. Imagine your at school and all you have is a chromebook. You can't use Google's remote desktop extension, so what do you do? Do you pay more for azure bastion than you pay for your VM? Do you wait until you find a loophole?  Do you wait until you have a period in the computer lab? Oh wait, I forgot, Your school only uses Macs. RIP that idea. Now you have to wait until you get home to your own computer just to save money. Well now, you can get free Remote Desktop and it's in the browser which means you can access it from anywhere! Or maybe you just want to use it locally. Well, you can do all of that and more with this free, open source remote dektop service.
